- Spearheaded the integration of Wiz into development workflows, enhancing detection of vulnerabilities, secrets, and misconfigurations in Infrastructure as Code (IaC) templates, containers and VM images.
- Optimised incident response through the integration of Wiz with Slack and Jira, orchestrating real-time alerting and automated issue resolution. Jira issues are dynamically generated based on severity, swiftly dispatched to stakeholders on a Jira Board, adhering to defined SLAs for remediation, minimising response time and human intervention.
- Collaborated with the workplace technology team to set up OKTA Single Sign-on (SSO) and Wiz Role-based Access Control (RBAC), simplifying access management through automated provisioning and deprovisioning.
- Revamped monthly patching by transitionin to a more efficient process. Previously, vulnerabilities were manually extracted from Qualys VMDR, shared them via Email and Slack. Now, with access to Wiz, teams can quickly identify resources requiring OS patching.
- Conducted comprehensive security assessments, including API testing, mobile SDK testing, and segmentation testing, to identify vulnerabilities and recommend remediation strategies.
- Assisted with the review of findings from HackerOne bug bounty and vulnerability disclosure program.
- Configured option profiles for authenticated vulnerability scans targeting network devices such as firewalls, switches, and routers for our data centres, enhancing our overall security posture and regulatory adherence.
- Collaborated with cross-functional teams to ensure compliance with industry standards and regulations such as Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) and System and Organisation Controls (SOC2).
